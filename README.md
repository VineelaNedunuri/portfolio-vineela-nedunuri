# Vineela Nedunuri :
I am an Electrical Engineer and i have studied Masters in Power system control and automation in India. I have two years of work experience as a lecturer at an engineering college in my home country. I am familiar with matlab and in my final year of engineering i did a project to analyze a three phase shunt active filter using simulink.

I have knowledge in PSO (Particle swarm optimisation) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) algorithms.In my masters i did a project using PSO algorithm to enhancing power system security under contingencies.The IT area is one of the fastest growing industries by offering many carrier opportunities in our world. Although I studied in the electrical field, I am very interested in learning and reading new things. So i thought this course would help me get the job in the future.
